# regen: generate Go types from the vendored OpenAPI spec (spec/openapi.yaml).
# There is deliberately no local re-vendor target. spec/ is bot-owned: the
# bundle is mirrored out of ezclassify/contracts by the spec bot and lands as
# ezclassify-spec-bot. .github/workflows/vendor-readonly.yml rejects a spec/
# commit from any other identity. To advance the spec, update contracts and let
# the spec bot propagate it, then run `make regen` here.
